## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Standards

**Technical Accuracy:**
- Verify facts and figures
- Cite sources for claims
- Include units (always Celsius for temperatures)

**Clarity:**
- Write for the target audience (data scientists learning energy, engineers learning ML)
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use German terms with English translations: "Heizkennlinie (heating curve)"

**Code Quality:**
- Include docstrings and type hints
- Add comments explaining domain-specific logic
- Test code before submitting
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

**Formatting:**
- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Follow existing heading hierarchy
- Include code blocks with language specification

### Language Guidelines

This repository uses a bilingual approach:

- **German technical terms** are preserved with English translations
- **Primary language** is English
- **Format:** "German term (English translation)" on first use

Example:
> The Heizkennlinie (heating curve) defines the relationship between outdoor temperature and supply water temperature.

### File Naming

Follow existing conventions:

- Documentation: `XX_Part_Name.md` (e.g., `01_Part_I_Domain_Fundamentals.md`)
- Notebooks: `XX_topic_name.ipynb` (e.g., `01_time_series_fundamentals.ipynb`)
- Python modules: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `heating_curve.py`)

## Code of Conduct

### Our Standards

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Assume good intentions
- Welcome newcomers to both energy and data science domains

### Scope

This repository focuses on:

- Residential heating systems (not industrial or commercial)
- German and EU standards (with openness to international comparisons)
- Practical ML applications (not purely theoretical research)
- Production-ready patterns (not just academic exercises)

## Project Context
This project supports preparation for data science roles in residential energy optimization, specifically heating systems in the German housing sector (Wohnungswirtschaft).

## Domain Focus
- Heating system types: gas/oil boilers, district heating (Fernwärme), heat pumps, CHP (BHKW), hybrid systems
- Key parameters: Heizkennlinie, Vorlauf/Rücklauftemperatur, Spreizung, hydraulischer Abgleich
- Regulatory context: GEG (§60b, §60c), German housing industry standards
- Target company context: Green Fusion GmbH, Berlin - AI-powered heating optimization

## Technical Stack
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, TensorFlow
- Data: SQL (TimescaleDB), GraphQL, REST APIs, MQTT for IoT
- MLOps: MLflow, CI/CD, model monitoring
- Domain: Time series forecasting, anomaly detection, control optimization

## Response Guidelines
- Use Celsius for all temperatures
- Retain German technical terms with English explanations (e.g., "Heizkennlinie (heating curve)")
- Provide code examples in Python when relevant
- Reference specific chapters from the study guide when applicable
- Be rigorous and precise - this is interview preparation for a senior role

## Key Metrics to Remember
- Average Vorlauf at 4°C outdoor: 64.4°C (too high)
- Systems without night setback: 70%
- Average savings from optimization: 16%
- Heat pump COP range: 3-5
- Condensing threshold for gas: return temp < 55°C
